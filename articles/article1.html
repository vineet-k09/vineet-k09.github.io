        As a part of group project we presented on Engines and Aerodynamics in our first college semester.
        The presentation was made on Microsoft Powerpoint using the help of Canva templates.
        <br>
        <h3 class="center" style="text-decoration: underline;">Engines</h3>
        This covered the basics of engines related to Formula 1 cars. Including the current F1 engine producers, important factors of an engine and evolution of engine over the years.
        <br><br>
        The current F1 engine are 1.6 litre V6 turbocharged engines. The engine is a hybrid engine with two electric motors. The engine is capable of producing 1000 bhp.
        <br><br>
        Engine provides the power that the car needs to accelerate, brake and corner. It has to be built in such a way that it takes care of Aerodynamics (Downforce is created when air is allowed to flow over the force, which helps pushing the car onto the track), efficiency and develped technology.
        <br><br>
        <b>In 1950s</b> the first F1 cars were powered by 2.5 liter naturally aspirated V12 engines. These engines were relatively simple, with open cockpits and drum brakes.
        This changed over several decades.
        <b>2010s</b> saw a continuation of the trend towards more efficient and environmentally friendly cars. The latest generation of F1 cars are powered by 1.6 liter, turbocharged V6 engines, and they are capable of producing over 1000 horsepower.
        <br><br>
        <h3 class="center" style="text-decoration: underline;">Aerodynamics</h3>
        Aerodynamics is the study of how air flows around objects. More specifically, it is the science of how air interacts with solid objects moving through it.
        <br><br>
        Several factors are covered under Aerodynamics. These include Downforce, Drag, Lift, etc.
        <br><b>Downforce</b> is a force that pushed the car down onto the track, which helps to keep the car stable at high speeds. This is especially important in corners, where the car is subjected to high lateral forces.
        <br><b>Drag</b> is a force that opposes the motion of the car. It is caused by the air resistance as the car moves through the air. Drag slows the car down, so it is important to minimize drag in order to go faster.
