    <p>Types of Articles
        There are three articles in English – ‘a’, ‘an’ and ‘the’. These articles are divided into two types namely:<br>Definite Article
        Indefinite Article
        Definite Article
        Among the three articles, ‘the’ is said to be the definite article. A definite article is used to determine something that is specific or particular. It is also used before plural nouns and to indicate the superlative degree of comparison. Furthermore, it can be used before collective nouns as well.<br>For example:<br>The Sun sets in the west.
        In the above sentence, the nouns ‘Sun’ and ‘west’ are proper nouns and are specific and so the definite article has to be used.<br>The children are playing cricket.
        In the above sentence, the definite article is used to determine the plural noun, ‘children’.<br>This is the world’s longest river.
        In the above sentence, the definite article is used to denote the superlative degree of comparison.<br>The crowd sang along with the band.
        In the above sentence, the definite article is used before the collective nouns, ‘crowd’ and ‘band’.<br>Indefinite Article
        The articles ‘an’ and ‘an’ are termed as indefinite articles. An indefinite article, as the name suggests, is used to indicate something that is not definite or specific. It can also be used before singular nouns.<br>Among the indefinite articles, ‘an’ is used before singular nouns that start with vowel sounds and ‘a’ is used before singular nouns that begin with consonant sounds.<br>For example:<br>I had an apple for breakfast.
        Do you have an eraser?
        I saw an aeroplane.
        She has a pet dog.
        My father is a doctor.
        My brother gave me a calculator.
        Usage and Exceptions – Points to be Remembered When Using Articles
        Articles are used extensively by English language users, and for this very reason, it is important to know where and where not to use them. In order to have a thorough knowledge of how to use the right articles in the right places, have a look at the following.<br>A or An?
        The article ‘an’ is normally used before words that begin with vowel sounds. However, this is often confused with the idea that it can be used before words that start with a vowel. Look at the examples given below to understand how this works.<br>I have an umbrella.
        This is an orange.
        An elephant was crossing the road.
        If you see here, the words ‘university’ and ‘unique’ start with a vowel. However, it does not have a vowel sound but a consonant sound ‘yu’ in the beginning. It is because of this reason that the indefinite article, ‘a’ is used instead of ‘an’.<br>Studying in a university will give you a lot of exposure.
        This is a unique way of communicating with birds.
        In the examples given below, ‘an’ is used before ‘MBA’ and ‘hour’ though they are words starting with consonants. This is because the word ‘MBA’ starts with ‘m’ which has a vowel sound (em) in the beginning. Likewise, the ‘h’ in the word ‘hour’ is silent, thus having a vowel sound in the beginning.<br>I have completed an MBA degree.
        It took an hour to reach the airport.
        Exceptions
        Words starting with a vowel, but use ‘a’ instead of ‘an’:<br>One
        University
        Unique
        Uniform
        Unit
        Eucalyptus
        Utensil
        Euro
        UFO
        Words starting with a consonant, but use ‘an’ instead of ‘a’.<br>Hour
        Honest
        Hourly
        MBA
        MBBS
        MA
        MSc

        NCC
        Honorary
        X-ray
        Xmas
        There are also some cases in which you will have to use the indefinite article ‘the’ before a common noun. Look at the following set of sentences to understand how this works.<br>Example 1: My brother and I are going for a wedding reception. The reception is held in an open lawn at 7 p.m.<br>Example 2: I saw a dog at the end of the street. The dog came running to me.<br>Example 3: Tharun watched a movie yesterday. He felt that the movie was too slow.<br>Examples of Articles
